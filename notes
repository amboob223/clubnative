* we had to update the node version to get it to work 
* when putting up an image use the image componenent from react native 
* and when using an image from the internedt we can use the url poprtey of the image component and when its from a local file we can use 

you can have diffrent values
we can put major components in its own seperate file
we use android studio for the emulator and to connect
I think our internet has to be on the same wifi for it to work

//when it start trippin run these commands 
    -curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    

    -nvm install node

If you are using this endpoint for testing purposes, you might want to handle the response as text instead of trying to parse it as JSON. Update the relevant part of your handleSubmit function as follows:

javascript
Copy code
const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  try {
    event.preventDefault();

    const response = await fetch('https://webhook.site/3925229e-a573-425b-aa15-d6706951500a', {
      method: 'post',
      mode: "no-cors",
      headers: {
        'Accept': "application/json",
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData),
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const result = await response.text(); // Parse the response as text
    console.log('Form submitted successfully:', result);

    // Optionally, you can reset the form data after successful submission
    setFormData({
      name: "",
      age: "",
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    Alert.alert('Submission Error', 'There was an error submitting the form. Please try again.');
  }
};
This change will treat the response as text, and you won't attempt to parse it as JSON. If you need to work with JSON data, ensure that the server returns valid JSON.
